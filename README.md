# Apache Notify

Did you ever want gnome notifications for apache errors?  The time has come.

## Usage

- Make the file executable `chmod +x `

- Pass in the error log as the only parameter to the script
  `./apache-notify.php /var/log/apache2/error.log`

- You'll receive a gnome notification upon any new errors :)
